# Peer Review Simulation - Issues and Fixes TODO

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Field Assignment Logic Bug
**Problem**: All papers are being assigned "Natural Language Processing" field regardless of venue
- AI_Researcher (specialty: Artificial Intelligence) has 26 NLP papers
- Data_Science_Researcher (specialty: Data Science and Analytics) has 36 NLP papers
- Only NLP_Researcher should have NLP papers

**Root Cause**: Venue-to-field mapping logic in PeerRead loading is incorrect
**Files to Check**: 
- `src/data/paper_database.py` (field assignment logic)
- `src/simulation/peer_review_simulation.py` (field mapping dictionary)

### 2. Review Assignment System Failure
**Problem**: 0 reviews completed despite 20 pending reviews
- All attempts fail with "You are not assigned to review paper X"
- Review requests succeed but completion fails

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between review assignment tracking and paper ownership
**Files to Check**:
- Review assignment logic in simulation
- Paper-reviewer mapping database consistency
- Review completion validation

### 3. Paper Distribution Imbalance
**Problem**: Uneven paper distribution across researchers
- Some researchers have 0 papers (CV, Robotics, Theory, Ethics, etc.)
- AI and Data Science researchers have all NLP papers
- NLP researcher has correct field but losing tokens

**Root Cause**: Paper assignment algorithm not distributing by specialty
**Files to Check**:
- Paper assignment logic in simulation initialization
- Researcher specialty matching

### 4. Token System Imbalance
**Problem**: Token flow without actual work completion
- NLP_Researcher: 27 tokens (lost 73)
- Data_Science_Researcher: 143 tokens (gained 43)
- No reviews actually completed to justify token transfers

**Root Cause**: Token transfers happening for failed review attempts
**Files to Check**:
- Token transfer logic
- Review completion validation before token transfer

- **Venues**: NeurIPS (5%), ICML (8%), AAAI (25%)
- **Reviews Generated**: 8 complete reviews with detailed scoring
- **Decision Accuracy**: 2/3 (67%) - **BELOW RESEARCH STANDARDS**
- **Key Failure**: High-prestige AGI paper (0.90 prestige, 9/10 novelty) → MAJOR_REVISION instead of ACCEPT

#### 🎯 **Main Multi-Agent Simulation Results**  
- **Scale**: 100 papers, 189 review requests, 10 rounds
- **Reviews Completed**: 8 (4.2% completion rate) - **IMPROVED FROM 0**
- **Token Economy**: 3,731 tokens circulated successfully
- **AI Intelligence**: Sophisticated reasoning ("I decline due to workload and past negative interactions")
- **Critical Flaw**: Still massive field mismatches (CV researcher assigned 26 AI papers)

### 🚨 **NEW CRITICAL PRIORITY FIXES**

#### **TODO 11: Bias Effect Strengthening - CRITICAL**
**Issue**: Prestige bias not working - high-prestige papers not getting favorable treatment
**Evidence**: AGI paper (0.90 prestige, 9/10 novelty) → MAJOR_REVISION (should be ACCEPT)
**Fix Required**:
```python
# Current: Too weak (0.1x multiplier)
prestige_multiplier = 1.0 + (author_prestige * reviewer.prestige_bias * 0.1)
# Change to: More realistic (0.5x multiplier)  
prestige_multiplier = 1.0 + (author_prestige * reviewer.prestige_bias * 0.5)
```

#### **TODO 12: Review Content Enhancement - HIGH**
