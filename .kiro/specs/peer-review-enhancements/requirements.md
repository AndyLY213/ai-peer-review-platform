# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive enhancement to the existing peer review simulation system to make it more realistic and representative of actual academic peer review processes. The system currently has basic multi-dimensional review capabilities, but needs significant enhancements across three phases: Core Realism Improvements, Advanced Behavioral Modeling, and Ecosystem Dynamics. These enhancements will transform the simulation from a basic token-based system into a sophisticated multi-agent environment that accurately models the complexities, biases, and dynamics of real academic peer review.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Review System

**User Story:** As a simulation user, I want a comprehensive review system with detailed scoring rubrics and structured feedback, so that reviews accurately reflect real academic review processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reviewer evaluates a paper THEN the system SHALL require scores on all six dimensions: novelty (1-10), technical quality (1-10), clarity (1-10), significance (1-10), reproducibility (1-10), and related work (1-10)
2. WHEN a review is submitted THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum word count requirements based on venue type (300-1000 words)
3. WHEN a review is generated THEN the system SHALL include structured sections: summary, strengths (minimum 2), weaknesses (minimum 1), detailed comments, and questions for authors
4. WHEN a reviewer submits a review THEN the system SHALL require a confidence level (1-5 scale) and recommendation category (Accept, Minor Revision, Major Revision, Reject)

### Requirement 2: Researcher Hierarchy and Reputation System

**User Story:** As a simulation administrator, I want researchers to have realistic academic hierarchies and reputation metrics, so that the simulation reflects real academic power dynamics and influence patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a researcher is created THEN the system SHALL assign a seniority level from: Graduate Student, Postdoc, Assistant Prof, Associate Prof, Full Prof, Emeritus
2. WHEN calculating researcher influence THEN the system SHALL use reputation scores based on h-index, total citations, years active, and institutional tier (1-3)
3. WHEN assigning review weights THEN the system SHALL apply reputation multipliers where Full Professors have 1.5x influence compared to Assistant Professors baseline
4. WHEN tracking researcher performance THEN the system SHALL maintain review history including review quality scores and reliability metrics

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Venue System

**User Story:** As a simulation user, I want different publication venues with realistic characteristics and standards, so that the simulation accurately models the academic publishing landscape.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN venues are defined THEN the system SHALL support six venue types: Top Conference (5% acceptance), Mid Conference (25%), Low Conference (50%), Top Journal (2%), Specialized Journal (15%), General Journal (40%)
2. WHEN papers are submitted THEN the system SHALL enforce venue-specific review standards including minimum review lengths, required detailed scores, and acceptance thresholds
3. WHEN reviewers are assigned THEN the system SHALL prefer higher reputation reviewers for top-tier venues and ensure minimum reviewer counts (2-3 per venue type)
4. WHEN decisions are made THEN the system SHALL apply venue-specific acceptance thresholds ranging from 5.0/10 for low conferences to 8.5/10 for top journals

### Requirement 4: Temporal Dynamics and Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a simulation operator, I want realistic timing constraints and workflow management, so that the simulation captures the temporal pressures and delays of real peer review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN papers are submitted THEN the system SHALL enforce realistic review deadlines ranging from 2-8 weeks based on venue type
2. WHEN reviewers submit late THEN the system SHALL track late submissions and apply penalties to reviewer reliability scores
3. WHEN checking reviewer availability THEN the system SHALL consider current workload, maximum reviews per month (2-8 based on seniority), and availability status
4. WHEN managing multi-round reviews THEN the system SHALL support revision cycles with updated deadlines and re-review processes

### Requirement 5: Cognitive Bias Implementation

**User Story:** As a researcher studying peer review, I want the simulation to model realistic cognitive biases, so that I can analyze how biases affect review outcomes and fairness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewers evaluate papers THEN the system SHALL apply confirmation bias where reviewers favor papers that align with their research beliefs (bias strength 0-1)
2. WHEN prestigious authors submit papers THEN the system SHALL apply halo effect bias increasing scores by 0-2 points based on author reputation and reviewer prestige bias (0-1)
3. WHEN multiple reviews exist THEN the system SHALL implement anchoring bias where later reviewers are influenced by earlier review scores
4. WHEN reviewers have recent exposure to similar work THEN the system SHALL apply availability bias affecting judgment based on recent paper exposure

### Requirement 6: Social Network Effects

**User Story:** As a simulation analyst, I want to model academic social networks and their influence on review processes, so that the simulation captures collaborative relationships and community dynamics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning reviewers THEN the system SHALL avoid conflicts of interest including co-authors, advisors, and recent collaborators within 3 years
2. WHEN calculating review influence THEN the system SHALL consider collaboration networks where closer network connections have reduced review weight
3. WHEN modeling citation networks THEN the system SHALL track papers citing each other and apply citation-based bias in reviews
4. WHEN simulating conference communities THEN the system SHALL model regular attendee networks and clique formation affecting reviewer selection

### Requirement 7: Strategic Behavior Modeling

**User Story:** As a simulation user studying academic gaming, I want the system to model strategic behaviors, so that I can analyze how researchers game the peer review system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN researchers submit papers THEN the system SHALL implement venue shopping behavior where rejected papers are resubmitted to lower-tier venues
2. WHEN modeling review trading THEN the system SHALL track quid pro quo arrangements where researchers exchange favorable reviews
3. WHEN detecting citation patterns THEN the system SHALL identify potential citation cartels with mutual citation agreements
4. WHEN analyzing publication strategies THEN the system SHALL model salami slicing where researchers break work into minimal publishable units

### Requirement 8: Funding and Resource Integration

**User Story:** As a simulation administrator, I want to model funding cycles and resource constraints, so that the simulation reflects real academic pressures and incentives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modeling grant cycles THEN the system SHALL simulate NSF, NIH, and industry funding with 1-3 year cycles affecting publication pressure
2. WHEN tracking publication pressure THEN the system SHALL implement "publish or perish" dynamics where researchers need minimum publications per year based on career stage
3. WHEN managing resource constraints THEN the system SHALL model lab equipment, student funding, and collaboration incentives affecting research output
4. WHEN calculating collaboration benefits THEN the system SHALL provide multi-institutional project bonuses for funding and publication success

### Requirement 9: Career Progression Dynamics

**User Story:** As a simulation user studying academic careers, I want realistic career progression modeling, so that the simulation captures how career pressures affect research and review behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modeling tenure track THEN the system SHALL implement publication requirements and timeline pressure affecting researcher behavior over 6-year periods
2. WHEN simulating job market THEN the system SHALL model postdoc competition and faculty position scarcity affecting strategic behavior
3. WHEN tracking promotion criteria THEN the system SHALL balance teaching, service, and research contributions with field-specific weights
4. WHEN modeling career transitions THEN the system SHALL support academic to industry transitions with different incentive structures

### Requirement 10: Meta-Science and System Evolution

**User Story:** As a meta-science researcher, I want the simulation to model evolving publication practices and system reforms, so that I can study the impact of changes to peer review processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modeling reproducibility crisis THEN the system SHALL implement failed replication attempts and questionable research practices affecting paper quality
2. WHEN supporting open science THEN the system SHALL model preprint servers, open access publishing, and data sharing requirements
3. WHEN integrating AI impact THEN the system SHALL model automated writing assistance and AI-assisted review processes
4. WHEN implementing publication reform THEN the system SHALL support alternative metrics, post-publication review, and new evaluation models
