## üìã **Issue Template**

```
### Issue #001: Logger not defined in enhanced mode initialization
- **Step**: Step 1.1 - Enhanced Mode Parameter
- **Date**: 2025-01-26
- **Error**: `name 'logger' is not defined` when initializing enhanced mode
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Priority**: High
- **Solution**: Moved logger definition before enhancement imports and used print() in exception handler instead of logger
- **Notes**: Logger was being used in module-level exception handler before it was defined

### Issue #002: Enhancement system imports failing
- **Step**: Step 1.1 - Enhanced Mode Parameter  
- **Date**: 2025-01-26
- **Error**: `cannot import name 'StructuredReviewSystem' from 'src.enhancements.structured_review_system'`
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Solution**: Fixed class name from `StructuredReviewSystem` to `StructuredReviewValidator`
- **Notes**: Class names in enhancement files didn't match import expectations

### Issue #003: Unicode encoding error in Windows console
- **Step**: Step 1.2 - Import Enhancement Systems
- **Date**: 2025-01-26
- **Error**: `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2713'` (checkmark character)
- **Status**: Open
- **Priority**: Low
- **Solution**: Replace checkmark characters with regular text for Windows compatibility
- **Notes**: Enhancement systems load successfully despite logging errors

### Issue #004: SimulationCoordinator initialization parameter error
- **Step**: Step 1.2 - Import Enhancement Systems
- **Date**: 2025-01-26
- **Error**: `SimulationCoordinator.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'enhancement_systems'`
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Priority**: High
- **Solution**: Removed incorrect parameter - SimulationCoordinator() constructor doesn't need enhancement_systems parameter
- **Notes**: All enhancement systems now initialize successfully

## üéØ **Issue Resolution Strategy**

1. **Document Immediately**: Record issues as soon as they're encountered
2. **Categorize by Priority**: High priority issues block progress, low priority can be deferred
3. **Continue Integration**: Don't let single issues block entire integration process
4. **Batch Resolution**: Fix similar issues together for efficiency
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure fixes don't break other functionality
