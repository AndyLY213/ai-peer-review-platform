# Peer Review Simulation Enhancement Plan

## Phase 1: Core Realism Improvements (High Impact)

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Review System
- **Scoring Rubrics**: 1-10 scales for novelty, technical quality, clarity, significance
- **Review Length Requirements**: Minimum word counts, structured sections
- **Recommendation Categories**: Accept, Minor Revision, Major Revision, Reject
- **Confidence Levels**: Reviewer confidence in their assessment

### 2. Researcher Hierarchy & Reputation
- **Seniority Levels**: Graduate Student, Postdoc, Assistant Prof, Associate Prof, Full Prof
- **Reputation Scores**: Based on publication history, citation counts
- **Institutional Prestige**: Tier 1, 2, 3 institutions with bias effects
- **Review History**: Track review quality and reliability

### 3. Venue System
- **Conference Types**: Top-tier (5% acceptance), Mid-tier (25%), Lower-tier (50%)
- **Journal Types**: Nature/Science (2%), Specialized (15%), General (40%)
- **Review Committees**: Area chairs, program committees
- **Submission Deadlines**: Realistic timing constraints

### 4. Temporal Dynamics
- **Review Deadlines**: 2-8 week review periods
- **Late Reviews**: Penalties and system delays
- **Reviewer Availability**: Sabbaticals, conference travel, workload
- **Multi-Round Reviews**: Revision cycles

## Phase 2: Advanced Behavioral Modeling (Medium Impact)

### 5. Cognitive Biases
- **Confirmation Bias**: Favor papers that confirm existing beliefs
- **Halo Effect**: Prestigious authors get better reviews
- **Anchoring**: First review influences subsequent reviews
- **Availability Bias**: Recent papers influence judgment

### 6. Social Network Effects
- **Collaboration Networks**: Co-authors, advisors, colleagues
- **Citation Networks**: Papers citing each other
- **Conference Communities**: Regular attendees, cliques
- **Geographic Clustering**: Regional research communities

### 7. Strategic Behavior
- **Gaming the System**: Strategic submissions, venue shopping
- **Review Trading**: Quid pro quo arrangements
- **Citation Cartels**: Mutual citation agreements
- **Salami Slicing**: Breaking research into minimal publishable units

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Dynamics (Lower Impact, High Complexity)

### 8. Funding Integration
- **Grant Cycles**: NSF, NIH, industry funding
- **Publication Pressure**: Publish or perish dynamics
- **Resource Constraints**: Lab equipment, student funding
- **Collaboration Incentives**: Multi-institutional projects

### 9. Career Progression
- **Tenure Track**: Publication requirements, timeline pressure
- **Job Market**: Postdoc competition, faculty positions
- **Promotion Criteria**: Teaching, service, research balance
- **Industry Transitions**: Academic to industry career paths

### 10. Meta-Science Elements
- **Reproducibility Crisis**: Failed replications, questionable practices
- **Open Science**: Preprints, open access, data sharing
- **AI Impact**: Automated writing, review assistance
- **Publication Reform**: New models, alternative metrics
